# Statistical Rethinking

> A repository of worked problems and examples from _Statistical Rethinking,
> 2nd Edition_ (McElreath, 2020), mainly in Julia and R.


## Introduction

This repository was created out of a desire to better understand Bayesian
statistics by learning from Richard McElreath's
[_Statistical Rethinking_][sr-book] textbook. Here, you will find (in progress!)
worked problems and example from the text. _Statistical Rethinking's_ language
of choice is R, but this repo also attempts to replicate some of the book using
Julia.


## Structure

The code in this repo is organized by book chapter. Within each chapter folder
is code for both the textbook examples and problems, in each language.


-----

_Note that this repository uses the 2nd edition of the book, published in March,
2020._
